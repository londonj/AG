- Always adhere to these security rules 

## No Server-Side Processing:
- It's a purely static HTML file with client-side JavaScript  
- No server-side code execution  
- No database connections  
- No file system access  

## No External Connections:
- Makes no AJAX or fetch calls  
- Doesn't load any external resources (scripts, styles, images)  
- No API calls to external services  
- All code is self-contained in the single HTML file  

## Limited Browser APIs:
- Only uses basic DOM manipulation  
- The only browser API used is the clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText()`)  
- No access to sensitive browser APIs  
- No local storage or cookie usage  

## Input Handling:
- All input validation is client-side  
- No data persistence  
- No form submissions to any endpoints  
- Input is only used for string manipulation  


The application is essentially a static web page that performs simple text formatting, making it very safe to host and run locally. You could even open it directly in a browser without a web server, and it would work the same way.
